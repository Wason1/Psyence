# 1 Introduction

Scientific Morality aims to increase in scope and accuracy as Science evolves to reveal how we can optimise for the sustainable well-being of consciousness. The word 'Scientific' comes from the fact that the moral compass that is developing here is built using the [Scientific Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method). Many of the assumptions made here are identical to the assumptions that allow traditional Science to function. 

Scientific Morality can be considered '[Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion) generation 3.0' because it retains some desirable aspects of previous Religions (e.g. synchronising beings to function together) while adding powerful functions made possible by advancing technologies. Anyone who follows the system of beliefs here can be considered a 'Scientific Moralist'.

# 2 Understanding Religion 3.0

## 2.1 The Use of the Word 'Religion' to Describe Scientific Morality
The word '[Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion)' is used to describe Scientific Morality for the following reasons:
1) A system of beliefs (or assumptions) are required to build the moral compass developed here. Even though these beliefs are generally considered to be obvious, they are technically beliefs.
2) A moral compass is designed here and Religion has generally attempted to build accurate moral compasses.
3) [Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion) has synchronised people towards a set of values and beliefs. Scientific Morality does the same.

## 2.2 Understanding Why this is Religion Generation 3.0
To understand why the value of 3.0 is used, [Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion) generation 1.0 and 2.0 must be understood. The decimal point is used to emphasize the concept that there are incremental 'grey area' changes between significant version changes.

### Religion Generation 1.0
[Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion) 1.0 can be thought of as a community holding a set of beliefs and common morals. These beliefs greatly influence their practises and can allow for a group of people to synchronise, working together to achieve common goals. It is very similar to a [culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture).  In [Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion) 1.0 the spiritual beliefs and morals of the community are held only in human minds and are transferred between people by word of mouth and observation of practises. There is no book (or other data source) that is generally considered to be the source of truth for the Religion.

### Religion 2.0
[Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion) 2.0 can spread with greater efficiency and with much greater precision than 1.0. The main difference between 1.0 and 2.0 is how the data that defines the [Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion) is stored. Rather than being stored in brains, it uses a far less corruptible physical medium (i.e. a book) to hold the beliefs, stories, morals and values. The data that defines the [Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion) is stored as text. [Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion) 2.0 is defined by a single book and is immutable (can't be updated or changed).

### Religion 3.0
[Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion) 3.0 retains the community synchronisation of 1.0 and the resistance to inaccuracies of 2.0. The major advancement is that the data that defines the [Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion) is easily updateable, and of increased scope (not limited to text). This means it can evolve with incredible ease and speed, all whilst keeping a precise definition.

Science is continuously revealing more of reality, and a more accurate reality as time persists. Since Scientific Morality uses the Scientific Method; mutability is a highly desirable trait. Text is (by definition) extremely limited, and hence limits how the origin of the [Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion) is stored. This limitation is undesirable.

The mutability of Scientific Morality is currently made possible by having the data stored digitally, as a Git Repository. The origin of Scientific Morality is currently stored [here](https://github.com/Wason1/scientificmorality/blob/master/Scientific-Morality.md) and **anyone** can contribute to its evolution.

# 3 Foundational Beliefs of Scientific Morality
1) The existence of [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness) is a reality.
2) An *objective* reality exists.
3) The existence of [Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number) is an objective reality.
4) The Scientific Method is a method that builds increasingly accurate models of reality. It increases our knowledge of reality and awareness of the scope of reality.
5) Moving towards an increase in [well-being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being) of consciousness is desirable.
6) '[Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good)' and '[evil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil)' actions are in relation to their effects on the well-being of consciousness. Good actions increase the well-being of consciousness and evil (bad) actions do the contrary.
7) [Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good)' and [evil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil) actions *can* be determined by the Scientific Method.
