# 1 Introduction

Scientific Morality aims to increase in scope and accuracy as Science evolves to reveal how we can optimise for the sustainable well-being of consciousness. The word 'Scientific' comes from the fact that the moral compass that is developing here is built using the Scientific Method. Many of the assumptions made here are identical to the assumptions that allow traditional Science to function. 

Scientific Morality can be considered 'Religion 3.0' because it retains some desirable aspects of previous Religions (e.g. synchronising beings to function together) while adding powerful functions made possible by advancing technologies. Anyone who follows the system of beliefs here can be considered a 'Scientific Moralist'.

# 2 Understanding Religion 3.0

## 2.1 The Use of the Word 'Religion' to Describe Scientific Morality
The word 'Religion' is used to describe Scientific Morality for the following reasons:
1) A system of beliefs (or assumptions) are required to build the moral compass developed here. Even though these beliefs are generally considered to be obvious, they are technically beliefs.
2) A moral compass is designed here and Religion has generally attempted to build accurate moral compasses.
3) Religion has synchronised people towards a set of values and beliefs. Scientific Morality can do the same.

## 2.2 Understanding Version 3.0
To understand why the value of 3.0 is used, Religion 1.0 and 2.0 must be understood. The decimal point is used to emphasize the concept that there are incremental 'grey area' changes between significant versions changes.

### Religion 1.0
Religion 1.0 can be thought of as a community holding a set of beliefs and common morals. These beliefs greatly influence their practises and can allow for a group of people to synchronise, working together to achieve common goals. Working together allows beings to be much more powerful than an individual working alone. The beliefs and morals of the community are held only in human minds and are transferred between beings by word of mouth and observation of practises. There is no accepted book or other source of truth for the Religion.

### Religion 2.0
Religion 2.0 can spread with greater efficiency and with much greater precision than 1.0. The main difference between 1.0 and 2.0 is how the data that defines the Religion is stored. Rather than being stored in brains, it uses a far less corruptible physical medium (i.e. a book) to hold the beliefs, stories, morals and values. The data that defines the Religion is stored as text. Religion 2.0 is defined by a single book and is immutable (can't be updated or changed).

### Religion 3.0
Religion 3.0 retains the community synchronisation of 1.0 and the resistance to inaccuracies of 2.0. The major advancement is that the data that defines the Religion is easily updateable, and of increased scope (not limited to text). This means it can evolve with incredible ease and speed, all whilst keeping a precise definition.

The Science is continuously revealing more of reality, and a more accurate reality as time persists. Since Scientific Morality uses the Scientific Method; mutability is a highly desirable trait. Text is (by definition) extremely limited, and hence limits how the origin of the Religion is stored. This limitation is undesirable.

The mutability of Scientific Morality is currently made possible by having the data stored digitally as a Git Repository. The origin of Scientific Morality is stored here and **anyone** can request a change or update.

# 3 Foundational Beliefs of Scientific Morality
1) The existence of consciousness is undeniable.
2) An *objective* reality exists.
3) The existence of Numbers is an objective reality.
4) The Scientific Method is a method that (generally) builds increasingly accurate models of reality. It increases our knowledge of reality and awareness of the scope of reality.
5) Moving towards the greater sustainable well-being of consciousness is desirable.
6) 'Good' and 'bad' actions can be thought of in relation to their effects on the sustainable well-being of consciousness.
7) What is 'good' and 'bad' or 'moral' and 'immoral' *can* be determined by the Scientific Method and reasoning.
